# SUDOKU
Sudoku solver in C using the backtracking algorithm

Accepts input on the command line row by row or alternatively a file where
the grid is written.

## TODO
* I/O of arguments
  * Option `-f` for file `-n` for new and no option for user input `-o` for output
  * Implement argument separation and protection
  * File reading 
* Actual recursive solving
* Branch implementation with rows and subgrids
