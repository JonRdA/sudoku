# SUDOKU
Sudoku solver in C using the backtracking algorithm

Accepts input on the command line row by row or alternatively a file where
the grid is written.

## TODO
* Split into diferent files, solving & helpers? Don't like it...
* I/O of arguments
  * Option `-f` reading from file `-o` output file & `-i` manual input
  * File reading writting
  * User input, can rows be printed after input, already formatted?

## DOUBTS
* Use flag for options, or call functions from getopt switch?
